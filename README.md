# tic_tac_toe

This is one of my first ever walkthrough and lesson with Flutter.

So here is the original coding video:

And lots of appreciation to Mr.Pradip Debnath,
here is a link to his website:

So first of all, this repository is not 100% similar to the original code, I am trying to improve the original code, so that it could work perfectly like an actual Tic Tac Toe game.

- The original code will accidentally count player turn when the player tap the already tapped grid, which is not appropriate according to a real game rule, since the person doesn't actually play his/her turn.
- The timer won't stop when the the game result is draw.
- The board color won't be refreshed after the first match ends.

So I came up with this repo to share the improved version, hope this is helpful.
